        <h3>Background</h3>
        <img class="img-border" src="./images/services.jpg">
        <p>For my communications research class at BU, a significant part of it was a semester long research project
            carried out in small groups. My partner was interested in Film and TV, I was interested in UI/UX, so we
            decided to meet in the middle and research the UI/UX of streaming services. </p>
        <h3>Exploration and Prototyping</h3>
        <img class="img-border" src="./images/demo-screenshot.png">
        <p>Using my front end skills, I created mock web pages with different UI effects applied to placeholder movie
            cards. For example, I was inspired by the hover delay on Netflix to test whether this delay was as annoying
            to other people as it was to me.</p>

        <h3>Development and Result</h3>
        <img src="./images/report-screenshot.png">
        <p>My Partner and I worked hard to compile our results into a comprehensive research paper. My favorite result
            was that my intuition was correct, and the majority of respondants disliked the emulated Netflix delay.</p>
