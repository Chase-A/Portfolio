        <p>For my advanced design class at BU, our assignments were structured around one tourist destination of our
            choice. We then had to create a logo, article, website and app prototype for this chosen destination. I
            chose Tamarindo, Costa Rica because it was where I took my first solo vacation (which was awesome), and
            because I spent a
            significant amount of time there, so I knew what made sense for the various marketing material I needed to
            produce.

        <h3>Exploration and Prototyping</h3>

        <p>Although I reused assets throughout the projects, I wanted to experiment with different design language for
            each medium. Each project includes common themes and assets, but they are each meant to stand on their own.
        </p>
        <h3>Development and Result</h3>

        <p>By the end of the semester I felt that I had a good grasp of the many tools I used to create each piece.
            Illustrator for the logo, Indesign for the article, HTML, CSS, and JS for the website and Adobe XD for the
            app prototype.</p>
