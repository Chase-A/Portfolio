        <p>For my history of Boston class at BU, we were assigned to groups to complete research to then use to create a
            walking tour around Chelsea Massachusetts. Part of the project was to host this tour online, which I took
            charge of because of my web dev skillset.</p>
        <h3>Exploration and Prototyping</h3>
        <img src="./images/fires-figma.png">
        <p>The website and our group's written descriptions of each of the tours stops would be beneficial to read
            during the tour, so I made sure to plan the site to be mobile friendly while still looking good on desktop.
        </p>

        <h3>Development and Result</h3>

        <p>For the final site, I included alternate historical pictures when reading the descriptions to try to keep
            walkers engaged, as well as live weather from OpenWeatherMap's API as a way for site visitors to gauge if
            it's a good time to take the tour.</p>
