        <h3>Background</h3>
        <img src="placeholder.png">
        <p>I wanted to create a compelling React app for my portfolio, and at the same time create something that is actually of use to me. I have built a habit of daily meditation, and I especially enjoy guided meditations, but my favorite guided meditations are spread across many platforms, making them hard to access. This project aims to address this problem by providing an easy to use and easy to update interface for playing back these guided meditations.</p>
        <h3>Exploration and Prototyping</h3>
        <img src="placeholder.png">
        <p>When planning the meditation react app, I initially designed components for desktop. Soon I realized I would want to use this app on mobile, so I repurposed the initial design to work on mobile, and continued to iterate and refine this design until I was satisfied. The final design of the meditation card is the most important part of the app, and the mobile design ended up being functional on desktop as well.</p>
